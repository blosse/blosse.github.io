                                Hey! My name is Titus, I am software engineer
                                from Sweden. I currently live and work in
                                Lisbon.
                            </p>
                            <div class="about-long" id="about-long">
                                <p>
                                    <br />
                                    I am a 29 year old, computer science
                                    graduate from Göteborg, Sweden. I have
                                    recently relocated from Sweden to Lisboa
                                    together with my fiancée, where I work as an
                                    integration analyst. I like to describe
                                    myself as calm, down-to-earh and solution
                                    oriented.
                                    <br /><br />
                                    I am particularily interested in the fields
                                    of embedded systems and computer graphics.
                                    However, I have always had a soft spot in my
                                    heart for imagery and graphic design. I have
                                    therefore recently started diving into
                                    frontend development more and found it to be
                                    very rewarding! I am always eager to learn
                                    and excited about exploring different fields
                                    within software development! I equally enjoy
                                    digging down into a problem by myself as I
                                    do working in a team to find the perfect
                                    solution. I find that I do my best work in
                                    environments that allow for both.
                                    <br /><br />
                                    In my free time I enjoy music, photography,
                                    running and snowboarding.

                                I am most familiar with object oriented
                                programming and embedded programming. My top
                                programming languages are C++, C and Python.
