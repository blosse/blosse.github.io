                            Hey! My name is Titus, I am software engineer from Sweden, now living in Lisbon. Hire me!

                                <br>
                                I am a 29 year old, recent graduate from the computer science program at Chalmers Technical University in Göteborg, Sweden and I have recently relocated from Sweden to Lisboa together with my fiancée. I like to describe myself as calm, down-to-earh and solution oriented.
                                <br><br>
                                I am particularily interested in the fields of embedded systems and computer graphics. However, I have recently started diving into front-end development and found it to be very rewarding. I am always eager to learn and excited about exploring different fields within software development! I equally enjoy digging down into a problem by myself as I do working in a team to find the perfect solution. I find that I do my best work in environments that allow for both.
                                <br><br>
                                In my free time I enjoy music, photography, running and snowboarding.
